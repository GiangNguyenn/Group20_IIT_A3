        <p><b><big>1 . Risks</big></b><br><br>
            Likes I have mentioned above in the landscape part after synthesizing information. Our project might face various risks in the future. Some worth mentioning is: <br>
Suppose our project cannot develop fast, healthy, and occupy many users early after launch. The user could be losing interest since the website could not provide the needed information or satisfy the technology community's needs. This could lead to our product losing foothold in the market shares and end up lagging back from competitors.<br>
Another risk worth mentioning is the enthusiasm of the manager in the project. Not likes other products when they can work perfectly fine after completing the project. Our website after finishing, if not take care of postings as well as users control. The product can easily lose its original color causing the number of users to decrease and end up being closed<br>
Lastly, since our group doesn't have much experience in the security field, this results in our product facing a significant problem of user's information. If our product could not provide the user commitments about personal information security, major users wouldn't be trustworthy enough to use our product. This could lead to a domino chain reaction of people quit using the website. However, to minimize the risk, we have come up with Firebase's solution, which would be mentioned more below. <br>
