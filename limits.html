                <h3><b><u>↪The Approach↩</u></b><br><br></h3>
              <p>Initially, the project was more prone to a blog-like application, and there are many options to approach the problem. The idea started with a framework called Django, which is a Python based technology for creating websites, for the obvious reason our background is solely Python language. The Framework, however, is truly hard to master with our insufficiency in terms of knowledge at the moment. We later looked at some other possibilities, for examples, plain HTML 5/ CSS 3; Bootstrap 4, and the list goes on.</p>
              <p>The ideas are all boiled down to the most popular language for web app development at the moment - Javascript. It is so powerful because it supports the niche of software development. Optimising the efficiency of the code due to its Object-oriented nature. There are obviously many other things to take into account with OOP programming, but for now, for instance, applying Big O notation is too early and unnecessary for us all and the project itself.
Eventually, Bootstrap 4, REST APIs, REACTJS, Nodejs and some other dependencies are considered our most reasonable roadmap for the project. Perhaps several more technologies will be utilised as we go further into the development process. Let’s discuss those Technologies in details below:
</p>
            <br><br><p><b><u>↪Bootstrap 4(Front-end):↩</u></b><br><br>
              <p>This is a fairly easy framework to learn, considering our foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. This will be utilised to help us generate nice and neat User Interfaces. Considering the foundational knowledge we have in HTML/CSS, this can be the most possible orientation. Moreover, since we’ll be using Javascript, REACTJS, there is a framework available for merging these 2 technologies together called React-bootstrap.</p>
              <br><br><p><b><u>↪ReactJS(Front-end):↩</u></b><br><br>
                <p>we intended to create a multiple-site application, thereby, ReactJS serves perfectly as the solution. It makes the code reusable and sustainable. Moreover, since React is really popular at the moment, it has lots of open-sourced support that may help us implement the product faster and more efficiently. There are plenty of free external libraries designed on top of React, such as react-bootstrap(as mentioned above) or Material UIs, which would definitely automate our work in terms of designing the UIs. To add, the final product would be more user-friendly since ReactJS is the skeleton of many modern websites</p>
                <br><br><p><b><u>↪NodeJS(Back-end):↩</u></b><br><br>
                  In general, this is the way we desire to implement our Back-end solution. NodeJS helps to make everything really handy, and understandable.
                  <br><br><p><b><u>↪REST APIs:↩</u></b><br><br>
                    We took the list of all free and open-sourced REST APIs from this list <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#cryptocurrency"> public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development.</a> and will figure out more usages to make the most out of them. This is helpful because REST APIs provide real-time information, and they are fairly simple to get the data provided by third-party websites and sort through it to find the information that you want. In the future, given we want to get some other types of information, we may have to get a license to legally fetch the desired data. We have thought of Postman APIs service <a href="https://www.postman.com ">https://www.postman.com </a> to get access to all the API that we possibly add to the site in the future.
                    <br><br><p><b><u>↪Firebase:↩</u></b><br><br>
                      <p>As we have mentioned that we currently lack Information Security support, we will use Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/products) - a cloud-based service that helps with authentication(and more than that), it can replace Nodejs completely but it has Nodejs as the baseline so the compatibility is not a problem. Additionally, as students, we don’t have enough human resources to build our own solution architecture. Especially, database design for a social media platform is a crucial part of the problem.
By using Firebase, we can be able to embed many software services that we may lack to accomplish the project to the fullness. Firebase is also really prestigious since they’re owned and maintained by Google, which is considered similar t`o AWS but much more straightforward to use.

  <p><b>→Unit Testing:</b> Developers validate their code by testing it using acceptance criteria <br>
<b>→Manual Testing:</b> Have friends and relatives use the product and collect there feedback.<br>
<b>→Automation:</b> using Selenium Webdriver and other tools to run the test case by executing test code.<br>
