        <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</big></b><br><br>
              Machine Learning(ML) is a relatively new area in modern Computer Science, yet it has been having significant impact the progression of the field. In 1952, it was first proposed by Arthur Samuel under the form of Checker game which could learnt as it played.  Since that moment onwards, the theory has been utilized in many applications, as it opened a new way for people to optimize their program, as Arthur Samuel stated:” Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” <br>
              Reference : <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning</a>
              <br><br>The definition of Machine Learning is more thoroughly explained by Tom Mitchell in 1998 as:” A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measure by P, improves with experience E.”
            Currently, ML has been proven to be extremely applicable since Tech Giants like Google, Salesforce, Facebook, etc. are leveraging ML algorithms into their products. Particularly, some well-known usages of ML can be listed as: Manual Data Entry, Detecting Spam, Product Recommendation, Medical Diagnosis, Financial Analysis, Image Recognition, and the list goes on. The applications of ML are so widespread that people merge them into their daily life without being aware of them.
            <br>
            Let’s discuss a very typical example, most of us are vey familiar with Google and perhaps use its services for our demands/problems on daily basis. Back in 2010, Google declared that they were the first company to use ML into their technologies and services. For instance, its recommendation list after one types a word or a phrase, its Webs Rankings, and how it weeds out low-quality pages is fully or partly based on the Machine Learning algorithms. The technology for this recommendation system is known as RankBrain – a complicated Deep Neural Net Work that yields proper required results for users. Additionally, ML is also used in Google Translate to enhance the accuracy of the translation, its algorithms analyses thousands of millions of documentations that have already been translated from one language to another and figure out the most compatible pairs of words.
            <br>
            Another valuable application of ML is prediction of the stock market. There are many investment and trading firms developed their own or bought third – party algorithms to predict their businesses projection in the future. With the huge capacity of data analysis that Machine Learning offers, predicting the financial market is no where near impossible anymore. From the data from the past of a certain market/stock, ML algorithms can return the future trend , or it is also able to give markers for an event (plummets, peaks, etc.). Many people still doubt the reliability of those model but it is proving its position in the field day by day.
            <br>
        <b><big> <br><br> 2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
        <p>With those being said, Machine Learning is obviously having such a great impact on the society, especially in dynamic cities and nations. Since various human activities are being automated by technology, Machine Learning can fully or partially take part in and even complement the automation processes. In a foreseeable future, Machine Learning is likely going to be a commonsense in many fields, in other words, we may not even be aware of how artificial it is. At the moment, in this pandemic period, Machine Learning is applied in many projects to generate data that predict the projection in the future; thereby, it would help to get the general vision and result in optimal measures. Additionally, there are many companies that provide scheduling service, which are highly on-demand currently since most of the workforce-related activities have been moved remote.
One of the highlights of Machine Learning transformation in the recent years is autonomous vehicles, and the brightest representative is Tesla. </p>

<b><big> Group processes and communications</big></b><br><br>
<p> We all know that group communications are one of the most important keys that leads to the success of the team and the project itself. That is why we communicate every day via social media such as Facebook Messenger, texting, Docs or sometimes we will call if there is something urgent. Due to the Coronavirus, we rarely meet each other face to face but we still organize at least 1 to 2 times a week. And almost every day we will summarize what we accomplished in the report and talk about the working process. If we have a group member who does not respond to communications, we will have to remind him if it is the first time but the punishment will be increased for the next time he/her occurs. But that situation hardly occurs so we don’t have to worry about it. And sometimes after the class time (apart from lectures and tutorials), we have a small talk about the project progress and how to achieve it in a limited time.</p>

        <b><big> Skills and Jobs</big></b><br><br>
        <p> 1. Written communication - writers </p>
<p> In order to be a successful writer, they have to achieve some important quality for writers. The most important qualities of a writer are writing skills, adaptability and creativity. “Writers and authors must be able to write clearly and effectively in order to convey feeling and emotion and communicate with readers” (collegegrad.com, n.d). With the support of adaptability and creativity, the writer will be able to develop interesting plots and ideals with manipulating many platforms and programs, including various content management systems (CMS) (collegegrad.com, n.d). The writer also needs to have critical-thinking skills to convert the new ideas from the organization successfully to the readers. Teamwork and determination are also skills required because it will be more professional to drive to meet the deadlines and communicate with other team members to create a perfect project.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Web development - software engineering </p>
        <p>Besides the deep understanding of programming languages such as Python, Java and Microsoft C#; a web developer that we want to employ also needs to have some vital skills set like planning, teamwork/collaboration and problem-solving skills. A web developer will have problem-solving skills to find the best solution in the limited time with detailed planning progress in order to achieve goals before meeting deadlines. He/she also needs to be able to perform well with other team members to make the project as perfect as possible.</p>
        <p> 3. Database - database engineering </p>
        <p> In order to be a good database engineer, they must have some vital skills that help the team to reach success. A person who we are looking for will have a detailed plan of what to do in order to achieve the goal in a limited time. This person will have to be patient and has the problem-solving skill to solve the best solution. Teamwork/collaboration will be an important key that we look for to create a better team in the future. Besides the generic skills, database engineering must have skills related to the IT field like a good understanding of programming languages, SQL and platform knowledge ( including Microsoft SQL Server), debugging and optimization. Because the database is the foundation of the whole project, the person who aims for this possession will have the leadership skill because it is essential to other people to understand the concept that they are trying to create.
</p>
        <p> 4. Security and confidentiality -cybersec engineering </p>
        <p> The cybersecurity engineering we are looking for will have a good understanding of programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, Python. Besides that, he/she will have good communication with the team to make the project as perfect as possible in a limited time. The person who is employed at this position will have a good troubleshooting and problem-solving skill to correct flaws from other teams members. Because we are in the early stage of the project so we don’t need the possession yet but we will possibly consider it  for the future. </p>
