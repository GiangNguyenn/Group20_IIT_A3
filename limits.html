        <p><b><big>1 . Risks</big></b><br><br>
            Likes I have mentioned above in the landscape part after synthesizing information. Our project might face various risks in the future. Some worth mentioning is: <br>
Suppose our project cannot develop fast, healthy, and occupy many users early after launch. The user could be losing interest since the website could not provide the needed information or satisfy the technology community's needs. This could lead to our product losing foothold in the market shares and end up lagging back from competitors.<br>
Another risk worth mentioning is the enthusiasm of the manager in the project. Not likes other products when they can work perfectly fine after completing the project. Our website after finishing, if not take care of postings as well as users control. The product can easily lose its original color causing the number of users to decrease and end up being closed<br>
Lastly, since our group doesn't have much experience in the security field, this results in our product facing a significant problem of user's information. If our product could not provide the user commitments about personal information security, major users wouldn't be trustworthy enough to use our product. This could lead to a domino chain reaction of people quit using the website. However, to minimize the risk, we have come up with Firebase's solution, which would be mentioned more below. <br>

<b><big> Group processes and communications</big></b><br><br>
<p> We all know that group communications are one of the most important keys that leads to the success of the team and the project itself. That is why we communicate every day via social media such as Facebook Messenger, texting, Docs or sometimes we will call if there is something urgent. Due to the Coronavirus, we rarely meet each other face to face but we still organize at least 1 to 2 times a week. And almost every day we will summarize what we accomplished in the report and talk about the working process. If we have a group member who does not respond to communications, we will have to remind him if it is the first time but the punishment will be increased for the next time he/her occurs. But that situation hardly occurs so we don’t have to worry about it. And sometimes after the class time (apart from lectures and tutorials), we have a small talk about the project progress and how to achieve it in a limited time.</p>

        <b><big> Skills and Jobs</big></b><br><br>
        <p> 1. Written communication - writers </p>
<p> In order to be a successful writer, they have to achieve some important quality for writers. The most important qualities of a writer are writing skills, adaptability and creativity. “Writers and authors must be able to write clearly and effectively in order to convey feeling and emotion and communicate with readers” (collegegrad.com, n.d). With the support of adaptability and creativity, the writer will be able to develop interesting plots and ideals with manipulating many platforms and programs, including various content management systems (CMS) (collegegrad.com, n.d). The writer also needs to have critical-thinking skills to convert the new ideas from the organization successfully to the readers. Teamwork and determination are also skills required because it will be more professional to drive to meet the deadlines and communicate with other team members to create a perfect project.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Web development - software engineering </p>
        <p>Besides the deep understanding of programming languages such as Python, Java and Microsoft C#; a web developer that we want to employ also needs to have some vital skills set like planning, teamwork/collaboration and problem-solving skills. A web developer will have problem-solving skills to find the best solution in the limited time with detailed planning progress in order to achieve goals before meeting deadlines. He/she also needs to be able to perform well with other team members to make the project as perfect as possible.</p>
        <p> 3. Database - database engineering </p>
        <p> In order to be a good database engineer, they must have some vital skills that help the team to reach success. A person who we are looking for will have a detailed plan of what to do in order to achieve the goal in a limited time. This person will have to be patient and has the problem-solving skill to solve the best solution. Teamwork/collaboration will be an important key that we look for to create a better team in the future. Besides the generic skills, database engineering must have skills related to the IT field like a good understanding of programming languages, SQL and platform knowledge ( including Microsoft SQL Server), debugging and optimization. Because the database is the foundation of the whole project, the person who aims for this possession will have the leadership skill because it is essential to other people to understand the concept that they are trying to create.
</p>
        <p> 4. Security and confidentiality -cybersec engineering </p>
