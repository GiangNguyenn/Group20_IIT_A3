      <big><b>1 . What is our aim?</b></big><br><br>
        <p>After discussing within our team, we have decided to make a website about the latest information about technology in the world. Although there are a lot of similar websites like ours, in our country, we didn’t see the impact they made to society and the view of fascinating new technologies. Consequently, this project aims to make a new website about technology which aims to the Vietnamese viewer and make a huge impact for the tech-lover community. </p>
        <strong><b>Project objective</b></strong><br>

<p> 1. Review the literature concerning people who are interested in tech and why they find it interesting in this field. First we need to find out what is the demand for this field. Because this is a new field and needs time to develop and get more popular in order to make a successful website. The majority of viewers who are interested in tech are tech lover, gamer and organization. From that information we can add some more interesting information about gaming technology and anything which relates to that information.</p>
<p> 2. Always catch up to date with the latest news for the website by scaling up the APIs over time. Because we need a secure and value source of information to post to our website which will make it more attractive to the viewer. So when they first visit our website, they get amazed about the quality of the new and up to date new compared with the other famous tech websites on the internet.</p>
<p> 3. Bring the freshest vibe that other websites don't have. After researching, we find out that some of the tech webs actually need major upgrades for the design because it didn’t bring out the vibe of an innovation of technology. For this part, we will try to understand the demand of the viewer and combine it with our design to create our own unique design for our website.</p>
<p> 4. Identify if the website needs improvements or alterations to match the viewer demand. In our opinion, our valued viewer is one of the elements that helps us to get more popular for the tech community. We will try our best to listen and understand their opinion to make the website better in the future.</p>
<p> 5. Complement for the shortcoming of each individual in the team. Because we are a group of newbies in this field, we still lack experience in many aspects. We will try our best to improve our skills over time and the best way to do it is to learn from the pioneer and listen to the feedback from our customer.</p>

          <br/>Moreover, Blockchain, the first real implementation of this technology, is Bitcoin ( cryptocurrencies ), which was really successful in the recent period. Shortly, some of the application might apply Blockchain in the near future are:
      <br/>
        - The "smart contract" when people have to make a new contract for different purpose likes real estate or economic contracts.
        <br/>
      - "Medical record" since nowadays different hospitals have a different for each patient.
    <br/>
      - "Election" since it could provide the transparency of the votes.
        </p>
      <strong><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></strong><br>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that uses digital files ( blockchain technology base ) as money; the most successful one worth mentioning is bitcoin.
<br/>To explain things, better we could see Bitcoin as digital gold:
<br/>- When gold is mining with pickaxes, bitcoin is mining with computer hardware ( CPU < GPU < ASIC) to solve complex math problems in order to get a reward
<br/>- Both of them are not controlled by the central bank and can be sent directly from user to user (decentralized and peer to peer cash system)
<br/>- Similar to gold each bitcoin cannot be replicated, and both of them have limited amounts on earth ( 21million bitcoin to be exact), and because of “blockchain”, all transition are verified and recorded by every computer that process bitcoin, so it is impossible to counterfeit a bitcoin.
<br/><br/>However, different types of Cryptocurrency could have distinct features. For example, some would use different has functions like scrypt ( Litecoin  ) rather than SHA-256 (Bitcoin), increased the size of each block for faster transitions ( Bitcoin Cash), some could make a transition without disclosing the sender, receiver or the amount transacted ( Zcash ).
      </p>

        <br><br><br><br>

          <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
          <strong><b>Block Chain</b></strong><br>
         <p>Research has found that some potential impact of Blockchain in the near future are: For instance, supply chain process with Blockchain apply user could see know where their goods are at any times, big data uses when data need to be stored in large quantity, and access can be accessed fast, for example, likes tesla autopilot cars chain with traffic lights, auto pay tolls, etc. Also, public services could potentially apply Blockchain soon, like in the land register and proof of ownership when it comes to selling.
           <br/>
           Moreover, could it replace or make redundant any current jobs and technologies. In my opinion, I believe that blockchain, if apply, could take away many jobs at many companies, mostly centralized ledger-based businesses, for instance, banks, notaries, and the people who are running this system.
         </p>

         <strong><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></strong><br>
         <p>According to experts, Bitcoin promised to be one of the main ways we would exchange for goods. From my point of view, bitcoin could decrease the number of cash transactions if it is widely used. Another point worth noting is that people without bank account back then would be limited in different ways since most transition required the bank authority, with Cryptocurrencies. This could be solved since each transaction verifies itself.
         </p>
         <br><br><br><br>


        <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b><br><br>
          <p>Both <b>BlockChain</b> and <b>Cryptocurrencies</b> are not really affected my life to this point. Nevertheless, I believe that shortly both of these technologies will change other's life. For instance, back then, when I apply for RMIT or study abroad procedures, I have to went to People’s Committee to notarized my record, which was a painful process since it is taking many hours. If we can apply Blockchain to the study record of every person in our country, it would not take me to much effort to notarize my papers. Furthermore, with Cryptocurrencies, if bitcoin is used more widely and is approved by the regulations of Vietnam, we could pay for goods, make a transaction, and trade with fewer fees. Also, my family real estate business will be much easier if BlockChain was applied since we don't need to go to the painful process of "proof of ownership".
